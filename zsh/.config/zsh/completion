# The `autoload` command load a file containing shell commands. To find this
# file, Zsh will look in the directories of the Zsh file search path, defined
# in the variable $fpath, and search a file called compinit.
# - It avoids name conflicts if you have an executable with the same name.
# - It doesn’t expand aliases thanks to the -U option.
# - It will load the function only when it’s needed (lazy-loading). It comes in
#   handy to speed up Zsh startup.
